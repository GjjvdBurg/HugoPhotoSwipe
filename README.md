Alright, how does this work?

Nope

hugophoto is a command line program. HugoPhoto is a class.
HugoPhoto has global settings for the one Hugo project the user is working 
with. The base directory for the HugoPhoto project is called the working 
directory.

These global settings are defined in a local hugophoto.yml file in the working 
directory. The global settings define:

	- markdown_dir
	- output_dir
	- output_format
	- large_dirname
	- small_dirname
	- thumb_dirname
	- max_large_dim
	- max_small_dim
	- thumbnail_dim
	- photo_dir
	- album_file

In the working directory, there are subdirectories for all the albums.
